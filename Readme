Input is a stream of:
(timestamp, price)

Output should contain:
timestamp of last event in stream,
value of last event in stream,
number of events in window,
sum of prices in window,
minimum price in window,
maximum price in window

Idea is simple:
Fold the Stream with the State that contain all information about the window to compute necessary output.
With this in mind the program should consist of at leas 3 parts:
  1. Algorithm to compute output.
  2. Streaming reading of input.
  3. Output writer.

1. The Algorithm:

Tha naive algorithm would be to save in state all measures that belong to the window,
and on each new received measure make next:

shift the end of the window to the new measure's timestamp;
remove from window all measures that don't belong to it after the shift;
recompute number of measures, sum, minimum and maximum.

Possible optimisations:

It will be better not to recompute all the values from scratch but reuse previous state.
Assuming that events are distributed evenly,
it would be much faster to compute sum and number of only removed measures from window,
and then just minus it from the previous state.

No need to recompute minimum and maximum also -
we can use some heap to store all measures in ordered for quick min, max lookup.
